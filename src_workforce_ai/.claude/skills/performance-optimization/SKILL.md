# Performance Optimization Skill

## Capability
Profile, analyze, and optimize system performance.

## Optimization Process
1. Measure current performance
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Analyze root cause
4. Implement optimization
5. Verify improvement
6. Document findings

## Common Optimizations
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- Async processing
- Resource pooling
- Algorithm improvements
- Network optimization

## Performance Targets
- API P50: <50ms
- API P99: <200ms
- Page Load: <2s
